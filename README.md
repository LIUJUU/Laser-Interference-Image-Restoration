# Abstract
With the widespread use of laser technology in military and civilian areas, laser
interference has become a significant problem for optoelectronic devices. Traditional image
restoration methods like filtering and interpolation often fail to effectively address nonlinear
damage and dynamic changes. Thus, this paper introduces a new deep learning framework
that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks and multi-head attention mechanisms to
extract multi-scale features, enabling a better understanding and restoration of image
structures. We created synthetic laser interference image datasets for five scenarios
containing 5000 images for testing. Experimental results show that this method not only
visually restores images damaged by laser interference but also performs well on quantitative
metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM).The PSNR
were all above 34 and SSIM were all above 0.98. Looking ahead, this technology promises
broader applications in laser interference scenarios, offering support for both military defense
and civilian technologies.
